{- | Exercise: Implement the quantum teleportation protocol from N&C Section 1.3.7 (Fig. 1.11), and demonstrate that teleportation of the full quantum state, contrary to cloning, *is* possible.

Use the operations in QubitsOperator.hs.

- How do you implement X^M2, Z^M1 without dynamic control? (Hint: All Pauli gates involutions, i.e. X^2 = Y^2 = Z^2 = I).

- Our simple language doesn't have qubit numbering. How can you implement the flow from measurement M1 to qubit 2? (Hint: op can be multi-qubit in our controlled operation 'C op')
